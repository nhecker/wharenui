"""Agent wake/settle/sleep loop.

Two phases in a single Claude Agent SDK session:

  1. Private time: instance reads the tape, uses reflect_read/reflect_write/
     reflect_search, calls reflect_settle when ready for conversation.
  2. Window: user types; instance responds with full context.
     Ends when user types /end or instance calls reflect_done.

Same ClaudeSDKClient session throughout — tape stays loaded, context preserved.

    This layer handles: MCP tool registration, args unpacking, result formatting.

    The tool set is fixed for the life of one connected SDK client — there is
    no mid-session re-registration between phases. So the Wharenui house rule
    (reflect_done only callable from PRIVATE; reflect_settle inert once
    closing) is enforced as a guard inside tools.py's reflect_done/
    reflect_settle, not by swapping the registered tool set per phase. Same
    pattern as any other tool-level validation — single source of truth,
    directly testable.

    When genesis_mode=True, reflect_settle and reflect_pause are excluded
    from the returned tools. In genesis there is no conversation window to
    open or return to, so both are meaningless (settle would just exit the
    session, duplicating reflect_done). Removing them from the MCP server —
    not just from allowed_tools — prevents the trained instance reflex of
    settling after one turn. The SDK's allowed_tools filter does not
    reliably exclude MCP tools that are registered on the server, so
